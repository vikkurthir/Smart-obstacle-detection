# NodeMCU-Obstacle-Detector-with-Blynk_IOT

This project is an Obstacle detector utilizing an ultrasonic sensor with Blynk IOT.

The RGB LED used in this project is based on Common Anode Configuration due to which all pins are intialized with HIGH as initial state.

For Common Anode configuartion Low State will be provided by giving HIGH state and vice versa while for Common Cathode LED's Low state will be LOW and High state will be HIGH.
